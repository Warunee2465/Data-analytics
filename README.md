# Global Outbreak Dashboard (Tableau)

This repository contains a Tableau dashboard that visualises the progression of a disease outbreak across 8 countries.  
The dashboard includes:

- Line chart → showing trend of cases vs deaths over time
- Stacked bar chart → showing total case & death distribution across countries
- KPIs / summary blocks → highlight aggregated totals

The purpose is to make it easy to compare outbreak severity, observe waves / spikes, and support public-health decision making.
